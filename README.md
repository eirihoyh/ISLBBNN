# ISLBBNN
Make Neural Networks more interpretable by using Input-Skip Latent Binary Bayesian Neural Networks (ISLBBNN). Allows for global explanation of predictions, and can also be used for local explanations.

To see different implementations, look into the the `example` folder. Local explanations are used in the end of all LRT notebooks.
